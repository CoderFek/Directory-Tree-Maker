## Directory-Tree-Maker

A simple one-file tool to make a `tree` structure of directories and subdirectories including files, in a text file. This helps you understand your workspace better and moreover
add this tree can be added to your articles to let people understand your workspace better.

The DirectoryTreeGenerator file contains all the full source code. There is also a gitignore which covers almost all the files and folders that you probably don't want people to see.
Only the root folder/file will be shown in such cases, making the tree concize and less lengthy.

### How to use?

Simple. Clone this repository or simply download the files in your working directory (recommended). Ignore the gitignore file if you have one in your workspace. Specify the path or
simply use "." for the current directory. Next enter the file name and wallah!!
